Welcome to Qinling's documentation!
===================================

.. note::

   Qinling (is pronounced "tʃinliŋ") refers to Qinling Mountains in southern
   Shaanxi Province in China. The mountains provide a natural boundary between
   North and South China and support a huge variety of plant and wildlife, some
   of which is found nowhere else on Earth.

Qinling is an OpenStack project to provide "Function as a service". This
project aims to provide a platform to support serverless functions (like AWS
Lambda). Qinling supports different container orchestration platforms
(Kubernetes/Swarm, etc.) and different function package storage backends
(local/Swift/S3) by nature using plugin mechanism.
